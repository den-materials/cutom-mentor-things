## Squads

- **Team Newsfeed**
  - Cameron
  - Ryan
  - Wes
  - Mike	
  
- Create a blog that a user can post into
- Store blog posts on some back-end (can be relatively simple for now) - either build yourself, or use free API
- Find a news API that you can pull relevant stories from 
- Make sure any API is free and can be scalable, also avoid complicated authentication for APIs
- Have a user-friendly layout that integrates these two features relatively seamlessly
- For styling, focus on layout, don't need to worry to much about fonts/colors/etc.

---

- **Team Messenger**
  - Emma
  - Quinn
  - Jared
  - Marissa

- Create a platform for messaging between users
- Create threads for each conversation (one user to one other user)
- For styling, focus on layout, don't need to worry to much about fonts/colors/etc.

- **Team Scheduler**
  - Courtney
  - Natalie
  - Jeff

- Create a platform for mentor and mentee to find a time that works for both to meet
- Ideally, we can have different size of appts (15 mins, 1 hr, etc)
- Can build from scratch, but API may be easier -- just make sure API is free and can be scalable, also avoid complicated authentication for APIs
- For styling, focus on layout, don't need to worry to much about fonts/colors/etc.

## Getting Started

You will need the code in [this repo](https://github.com/hollyewhite/custom_mentor) to get started.

If you are wondering what tasks need to be accomplished on the team, here is the [Trello for Custom Mentor](https://trello.com/b/EZAIMAMk/custom-mentor).

## Keeping in Touch

You will receive an invite to the Custom Mentor organization soon, if you haven't already.  In the `#general-assembly` channel, you can get help/feedback from other team members.  **Please adhere to the following rules as a courtesy to the team members**

- Please send only one set of questions per day (one Saturday, one Sunday)
- Understand that this is the weekend, so it may take a half a day or so to get a response.  Queue up enough work you can do without feedback for the rest of the day.
